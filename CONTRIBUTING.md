# Contributing to kora_weathersync

Humans and agents use the [shared Kora contribution standards](https://github.com/KoraFiveM/kora_docker_dev/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
(revision **2026-11-12.1**) and the self-contained [local Lua tooling guide](.standards/README.md).
Read this resource's README where present, AGENTS.md and relevant module guides first.

For new and relevant changed code: use four spaces, camelCase and StyLua's single-quote/120-column
style; keep transport handlers thin, server authority explicit, and compatibility adapters
on the owning implementation. Reuse Kora APIs and validators; place generic mechanics in
kora_lib and domain rules with their owner. Document public APIs, yielding/failure behavior
and cleanup. Keep unrelated reformats and restructuring separate.

## Local commands

Install the pinned StyLua/LuaLS releases from the local tooling guide and Python 3.10+.
Run from this repository root:

```sh
python3 tools/lua_quality.py list
python3 tools/lua_quality.py check
python3 tools/lua_quality.py lint
python3 tools/lua_quality.py check server/commands.lua
python3 tools/lua_quality.py format server/commands.lua
```

Formatting requires explicit targets. Check/lint never rewrite source; full-resource
checks expose existing debt and may fail before your change. Fix introduced findings,
report pre-existing failures, and use `--realm client` or `--realm server` for focused diagnostics.
Add new Lua files to `.standards/resource.json` with their actual realm and update the
runtime manifest where needed. No pipeline enforcement or automatic hooks are installed.

## Behavior tests

- `bash test/run.sh` (follow the local guide for interpreter/dependency requirements).

Add focused regression coverage for meaningful rules, public contracts, adapters and
failure/lifecycle paths. State in-game checks separately. Update matching docs in the
same change, inspect the diff, and report what passed, failed or was not run.

## Local constraints and policy reconciliation

Local/module AGENTS.md constraints remain binding. The shared manifest policy
requires explicit ordering where it matters; kora_lib's existing order-independent
module globs remain supported. Older local wording that says every manifest must
be non-globbed does not require rewriting unrelated manifests. LuaLS CLI contexts
are isolated even when an existing smoke test intentionally loads both realms.


Changes belong to this resource repository, separately from Docker setup and docs-site
changes. Shared tooling is a local snapshot; do not introduce a dependency on the setup
checkout. Keep resource-specific inventory and definitions when refreshing the snapshot.
